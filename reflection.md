# What Are The Steps in The Design Cycle

## Step 1:
Planning.
The first step in the design cycle is intendification, specifically identification of the problem, people who encounter that problem, and how that problem came to be.

## Step 2:
Designing
The second step is a developmental step, where you start thinking about your solution. This could be rough sketches of an idea, or just a guideline to follow.

## Step 3:
Development
Create a plan to follow, develop the solution, and get it ready to ship out.

## Step 4: 
Evaluation
Evaluate what you have created, and fix whatever may need to be fixed

##Step 5:
Implementation
Implement Your Solution to fix the problem you had.

# What is the purpose of the success criteria?

The success criteria are a guideline for what you need to create. This gives you base guidelines for what is absolutely necessary for your product to have at a bare minimum.

# What do you understand now about computers/Computer Science? That you did not before Unit 1.
## The Design Cycle
I had always somewhat understood the design cycle as it was the most natural system for me to use when developing a program

## Python
Python was the first major thing I learnt, so far I have only ever written code in Arduino C or Java, and this was my first time ever using python.

##Bridges
Other than that, the only other concept I can think of is to do with motherboard north and south bridges, as I always assumed the difference between PCI and PCIE ports was simply a different port or connection, I never would have guessed that it would be differences in which chip it connects to directly.

# What do I uderstand now about myself that I did not before unit 1
I guess I understand the level of commitment I can have to something to get it finished. What I mean by this is that most of my game was completed over two 6 hour coding sessions on the weekend after the project was assigned. I underestimated my own dedication, though when I code like this I often tend to not make as many changes to the code, which is why I strugged significantly with CPU and Database integration.

# What worked well for me during the unit 1 project
I am happy with my code as a whole, thanks to my previous experience with coding I had a headstart so did a project that was a bit more complicated, and I am satisfied with the result.

# What did not work well
My previous engineering teacher would call people "pros", meaning procrastinators. I was a pro. I didnt work on what needed to be implemented like the database, until rather late, and I especially procrastinated on the documentation itself.

# When does a developers role end.
In my opinion, the position of a developer ends long, long after the accomplishment of the success criteria. Needs change, and bugs and glitches can occur as more time passes. As the developer your job is also the upkeep of the code itself, and providing QOL updates as time passes and more problems occur or more things are needed to fulfill changing criteria. This can especially be seen as languages change, grow, and update, and so the code needs to be updated and ported to newer and more efficient languages.
