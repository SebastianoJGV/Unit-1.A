Here is my Poketext pokemon game. You can play this PvP with someone next to you or PvCPU with the AI.

Confirmation checks, score, sounds, and cpu have yet to be implemented, but I am working on those.

Currently you only have the options of fire, water, and grass. I am thinking of adding extra types, though am unsure as of right now.

Have fun!
